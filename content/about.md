title: "About Code, Lies, and Blargles"

---

Code, Lies, and Blargles contains random musings, rants, and field notes about software engineering, and sometimes other things.

I insist on using the Oxford Comma, far more flowery and intricate language than is wise, horrible pull-quotes (sometimes), general snarkiness, and, when bothered about something, foul language of the filthiest kind. Sike.

I'm a software engineer based in London, and sometimes available for hire, specialising in modernising cloud infrastructure and code deployment pipelines, and DevOps tooling for accelerated delivery of software at scale. I like [Go], [Linux], [Vim], [Mesos], [Docker], [shell scripting][shell], [The Twelve Factor App][12factor], and rational configuration schemes. I've also dabbled in just about every major language there is, growing up from a [QBasic] hacker back when I was 8, to a front-end whiz for a few years, then spent most of my career working full-stack on web projects in PHP and C#. I got into Go, DevOps and tool-writing a couple of years ago, and haven't looked back since. I also do some work on personal projects on iOS using [Swift] and [React Native][rn].
